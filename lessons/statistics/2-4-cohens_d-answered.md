[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

    CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)

   -0.088672927072602

Since the difference between first-born and others is negative, this means the total weight in pounds is higher for "others" babies, so first babies are lighter than others. The difference between these groups in total weight is slightly larger than the difference for length of pregnancy (-.09 compared to .03) - while it is a jump of about 3x more difference, it's important to note that even this larger measurement is less than one-tenth of a single standard deviation which is a very small difference. Perhaps someone with more domain knowledge could more properly contextualize this, but it seems like a small enough difference to not be significant.
